# brava-ground-truth-annotations

## Genebass input VCF for testing annotations
Goal is to ensure consistency between the different steps.

### Step 1.
* Generate VEP+loftee annotations using Hail as a wrapper
* Generate VEP+loftee annotations using Docker 

### Step 2. Process consequence
* Using Hail and gnomad's "process_consequence"
* Using custom python scripts to process consequence

### Outstanding questions
* SpliceAI needs to be tested too
* dbNSFP?
